# Class Imbalance
In a binary classification senerio, if 1) cost of false positive and false negative is the same, 2) negative class is predominant, the classifier would always predict negative.

## Strategy for solving class imbalance problem
1. Cost function based approach
    - Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)
    - Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN)
2. Sampling based approach
  2.1 Upsampling
  2.2 Downsampling
