# Different Classification Methods

## Concepts
- Classification: identify the category of new observation based on training with known dataset with obervations that are labeled with categories.
- Difference between classification and clustering: 
  - Classification is supervised, works with labeled data
  - Clustering is unsupervised, works with unlabeled data

## Types of classification methods
1. Linear classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression (LR)
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
  - Supported Vector Machine (SVM)
2. Non-linear Classifiers:
    - Kernel SVM
    - Nearest Neighbor
    - Decision Tree
    - Neural Networks
