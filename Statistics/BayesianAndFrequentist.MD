# Bayesian versus frequentist (non-bayesian / classical) statistics

# Concepts
1. Bayes' theorem: describes probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.
  - Bayes' formula: *P(A|B)* = *P(B|A)P(A)* / *P(B)*
2. Characteristics of bayesian method:
  - The use of random variable / unknown quantities to model all sources of uncertainty in statistical models including uncertainty resulting from lack of information
  - The need to determine the prior probability distribution taking into account the available (prior) information
  - The sequential use of Bayes' formula
  - While for frequentist, a hypothesis is a proposition (True/ False), in Bayesian statistics the probability that can be assigned to a hypothesis can also be in a range from 0 to 1 if the truth value is uncertain
3. Frequentist inference: draws conclusions from sample ata by emphasizing the frequency or proportion of the data. Used for statistical hypoehtsis testing and confidence intervals, etc..
