# Sampling and Resampling

## Conceps
1. Sampling: an active process of gathering observations with the intent of estimating a population variable
2. Resampling: a methodology of economically using a data sample to improve the accuracy and quantify the uncertainty of a population parameter

## Sampling types
  - Bernoulli samples: independent Bernoulli trials on population elements, trials decide whether the element becomes part of the sample
  - Cluster samples: divide population into groups, then a random sample is chosen from the cluseters
  - Systematic sampling: select elements form an ordered frame
  - SRS: select items completely rendomly, so each element has the same probability of being chosen as any other element
  - Strtified sampling: divide population into homogneous subgroups before getting sample, and sample each subpopulation independently
  - etc.

## Resampling types
  - Bootstrap: sampling with replacement from the original data
  - Jackknife: systematically leaving out each observation from a dataset and calculating the estimate and then find the average of these calculations
