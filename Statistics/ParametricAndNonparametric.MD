# Parametric and Nonparametric Statistics

## Concepts
- Parametric statistics: a branch of statistics which assumes that sample data come from a population that can be adequately modeled by a pro bability distribution that has a fixed set of parameters.
- Nonparametric statistics: a branch of statistics that is not based solely on parametrized families of probability distributions (e.g. mean and variance). Nonparametric statistics is based on either being distribuition-free or having a specified distribution but with the distribution's parameters unspecified.

## Parametric model examples
- Normal family of distribution
- Poisson family of distribution
- Weibull translation model
- Binomial model
- etc.

## Nonparametric model examples
- Histogram
- Kernel density estimation
- KNN
- SVM
- etc.
